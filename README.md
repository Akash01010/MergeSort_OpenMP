# MergeSort_OpenMP
Parallelising Merge Sort using OpenMP programming



To Run the program:
Step 1: Type gcc -fopenmp -o mergeSort mergeSort.c
Step 2: Type ./mergeSort (It will ask for no of threads to spawn. Then, it will automatically take input from a file named data.txt and sort it. Data.txt contains 1 million 5 digit random numbers.)
It will display the time taken to sort.(It will only print the time taken while sorting and not includes time for input and output taken by program)


If you want to see the sorted array, then uncomment the last section of the code.
